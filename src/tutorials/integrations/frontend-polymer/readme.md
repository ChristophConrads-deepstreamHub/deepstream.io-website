Polymer brings WebComponents to all browsers, allowing for the creation of web apps using DOM elements as the primary building blocks.

deepstream comes with its own polymer plugin that makes it easy to add data-sync directly to these DOM elements.

```html
<ds-record name="myRecordName" data="{{recordData}}"></ds-record>
```

or - if required - by extending existing elements with a minimal bit of javascript using [behaviours](//www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/behaviors.html):
```javascript
behaviours: [ Polymer.DSRecordBehaviour ]
```

You can find the documentation for all deepstream-polymer elements and behaviours here:

### Getting started with deepstream-polymer
The beauty of using Polymer is that you can build an entire data-sync application without a single line of javascript! Let's look at the building blocks you can use to get deepstream working with Polymer.

You can install deepstream-polymer via Bower using
```bash
bower install deepstream.io-tools-polymer
```
or get it directly from [Github](https://github.com/deepstreamIO/deepstream.io-tools-polymer).

Before we begin, let's start a deepstream server. If you haven't done that before, have a look at the [getting started tutorial](../../core/getting-started-quickstart/).

#### Connectivity
First, let's connect to deepstream. This can be accomplished by adding a `ds-connection` element. This creates a connection to deepstream based on the `url` attribute you've specified and exposes the [connection state](/docs/common/constants/#connection-state) and deepstream instance.

```html
<ds-connection
    url="localhost:6020"
    state="{{connectionState}}"
    ds={{ds}}>
</ds-connection>
```

Once we have a connection it's time to login. This can be achieved via adding a `ds-login` element. You can also log in anonymously by having an `auto-login` attribute present.

```html
<ds-login
    auto-login
    logged-in="{{loggedIn}}"
    ds="[[ds]]">
</ds-login>
```

Want to login with an actual user-name or password? Just supply them via your `auth-params` and call `login` when you're ready. Note, this step does require a tiny bit of javascript!

```html
<ds-login
    auth-params="{{credentials}}"
    logged-in="{{loggedIn}}"
    ds="[[ds]]">
    <input type="text" value="{{credentials.username::input}}"/>
    <input type="password" value="{{credentials.username::password}}"/>
    <!--
        Note: login binding is on the current scope and will require
        to be proxied to the login method - or you could create your own
        element that uses the LoginBehaviour
    -->
    <button on-click="{{login}}" />
</ds-login>
```

#### Records
Now that we're connected you can enable your elements to auto-sync their data with all other clients simply by using a `ds-record` element. This requires three attributes: a `name` to know what record to use, `data` to allow reading and writing to the record and `ds` to expose the deepstream client to the element.

```html
<template>
    <ds-connection ds="{{ds}}"></ds-connection>
    <ds-record name="[[name]]" data="{{data}}" ds="[[ds]]">
        <input type="text" value="{{data.name::input}}">
    </ds-record>
</template>
```

Note how there is another `ds-connection` element present. This is to access the same deepstream connection using a [global variable](https://github.com/Polymer/docs/issues/334) across the application.

#### Lists
Finally, let's look at [lists](https://deepstream.io/tutorials/lists.html). Lists are collections of record that are related to each other and can be iterated. This can be achieved by using a `ds-list` element. The attributes used are the same as `ds-record`, except the record names are exposed via an array called `entries`.

```html
<template>
    <ds-connection ds="{{ds}}"></ds-connection>
    <ds-list name="[[name]]" entries="{{todos}}" ds="[[ds]]">
        <template is="dom-repeat" items="[[todos]]" as="recordId">
            <div>RecordId : {{recordId}}</div>
        </template>
    </ds-list>
</template>
```

And that's it, everything needed to create an application with data-sync!

#### Building a more complex app?
Here's an example of how to combine all these concepts to build a to-do list with Polymer:
